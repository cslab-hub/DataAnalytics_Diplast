In the current developments towards a smart industry (4.0), more and more data is collected concerning your operation processes. Insights in the data could 
contribute to improving these processes. After getting the data from your systems, and validating it with help of the Data Validation tool, the Process 
Data Analytics tools provides insights consisting of reports, visualizations and other analysis methods that describe the state of your processes and/or 
machinery. The process analytics tool consists of several data analytics modules that describe and analyse the underlying process data. In this tool, we 
strive to perform data science techniques such as classification, clustering and pattern mining accompanied by visualizations. Within the tool, we focus on 
the analyzing Time Series data.

This repository can be used to run and analyse their data as described in the Di-Plast project. To use the tool, please carefully read the descriptions written in the .docx file. 



The Data Analytics tool is funded by the Interreg North-West Europe program (Interreg NWE), project Di-Plast - Digital Circular Economy for the Plastics Industry (NWE729, https://www.nweurope.eu/projects/project-search/di-plast-digital-circular-economy-for-the-plastics-industry/).
